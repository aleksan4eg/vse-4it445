# 1st Practical Class: Hello World

## Atom Text Editor

We suggest [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor to be used.

You can use any editor you like, but:

- you should be able to edit remote files over SSH/SFTP,
- it should support modern JavaScript (ES2015+) and JSX syntax.

### Download Atom

- Go to [atom.io](https://atom.io/) and donwload latest version
  - if you are on school machine go to **Other platforms** link below the download button.
    Then select **atom-windows.zip** (this is version that does not require installer).
- run Atom and go to Settings:
  - on Windows select `File` > `Settings`
  - on Mac `Atom` > `Preferences...`
- in Settings in left panel select `+ Install` section and install [Recommended Atom Packages](#recommended-atom-packages).

### Recommended Atom Packages

- [remote-ftp](https://atom.io/packages/remote-ftp)
- [language-babel](https://atom.io/packages/language-babel)
- [prettier-atom](https://atom.io/packages/prettier-atom)

Go to `Packages` > `Prettier` > `Toggle Format on Save`.

**After the installation of all packages please quit and start the Atom again.**

### Setup Project Folder

Go to `File` > `Add Project Folder...`, create new empty folder and select it.

### Setup SFTP Connection

(this requires [project folder](#setup-project-folder))

Go to `Packages` > `Remote-FTP` > `Create SFTP config file`.

This will open new `.ftpconfig` file with JSON configuration.
Replace it with JSON example bellow, and **change both `USERNAME`s in `"user"` and `"remote"` to your SSH username**:

```json
{
  "user": "USERNAME",
  "remote": "/home/USERNAME/code/cviceni/",
  "promptForPass": true,

  "protocol": "sftp",
  "host": "vse.handson.pro",
  "port": 22,

  "agent": "",
  "privatekey": "",
  "passphrase": "",
  "hosthash": "",
  "ignorehost": true,
  "connTimeout": 10000,
  "keepalive": 10000,
  "keyboardInteractive": false,
  "watch": [],
  "watchTimeout": 500
}
```

You can change to this:

```
  "promptForPass": false,
  "pass": "PASS",
```

and change `PASS` to your SSH password (but it's not very secure!).

**Save the `.ftpconfig` file.**

### Connect to SFTP

Go to `Packeges` > `Remote-FTP` > `Connect`. You will be asked about password to you server account (you have received it in an email).

Now you should see second tree view with files on server.

## SSH to Server

Open [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) (or any other SSH client) and connect to server.
`host`, `username`, and `password` is in your email inbox (port is 22).

```sh
cd code/cviceni/frontend
yarn install
touch tmp/restart.txt
```

Then open `http://dev.frontend.USERNAME.vse.handson.pro/` (replace `USERNAME` with your SSH usrname).

## üíªüèÉ Run Frontend on Your Local Machine

### Requirements

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  - use of command line tool is suggested
- [Node.js v10.16.2](https://nodejs.org/)
  - use of [nvm - Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) is suggested
    - this allows simple management of multiple Node.js versions on your compouter
    - to install 10.16.2 run `nvm install 10.16.2`
    - to use 10.16.2 run `nvm use 10.16.2` (this may be required each time you start new Terminal session)
  - if `nvm` is not your cup of tea, you can donwload it directly from [Node.js v10.16.2](https://nodejs.org/) site

### Clone Git Repo

Open Terminal or Command line and type:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cngroupdk/vse-4it445.git
```

### Install Dependencies

**Globla Dependencies**

```sh
npm install --global yarn
```

**Project Dependencies**

```sh
cd vse-4it445/frontend
yarn install
```

### Run Local Dev Server

```sh
cd vse-4it445/frontend
yarn start
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
